# Team Profile Generator

## Description
This app provides a team profile based on user input that will allow users to create their own team.
Most of the app is based on a command line interface (CLI) that gives the user a way to inteact with the app.
The app will display the selected input from the user in a basic html file.
Developing this app allowed me to learn how to make the use of CLI in developing an app.

## Installation
The app needs node modules and npm jest and npm inquirer.
The main command for runnning the app is "node index.js".

## User Story

As a manager a user want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that a user have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

The app will generate a html file where the team will be displayed.
A screenshot of the html file is like this:
